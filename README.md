# The-Art-of-Compression

The inspiration for this assignment came from an [article](https://mymodernmet.com/algorithm-art-color-study-dimitris-ladopoulos/) about an artist whose work recreates classic portraits with a blocky effect. The exact algorithm he used is not given in the article, but we will create similar images using a strategy for image representation that underlies common lossy image compression algorithms.
